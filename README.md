# Spacestagram

### Spacestagram: Image-sharing from the final frontier.

## By Michael Reiersgaard

## Technologies Used

1. Ruby v2.6.6
2. Rails v6.1.4
3. [NASA APOD](https://github.com/nasa/apod-api)
4. Heroku
5. Devise
6. Bootstrap
7. dotenv
8. httpparty

## Description

I chose to take on this challenge with Ruby on Rails to deliver "Spacestagram"! utilizing NASA's Astronomy Picture Of The Day API. I wanted to go a little beyond the requirements to include basic user functionality so separate users can have their own likes which add to the total. I've included test account info on the login page, though a user can create their own account as well.

# Setup/Installation Requirements

## Intial Project Setup

- Ruby is required, download and install [https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
- Bundler is required, install using the terminal with `gem install bundler`
- Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and correctly running on your local machine
- Create a directory to clone the public repository from GitHub using `git clone <https://github.com/mireie/spacestagram.git`>
- Enter the root of the project directory and install all gems with `bundle install`

## Initializing the Database

- Update the `config/database.yml` file to match your PostgreSQL setup
- Initialize the database with `rake db:create` and initialize tables with `rake db:migrate`
    - If you encounter errors here, your `database.yml` file is likely not set up correctly and you skipped the previous step!
- Seed the database with products and reviews with the terminal command `rake db:seed`

## Running the Application

- To run the site on your local machine in the terminal run `rails s`
- Open your browser and navigate to `localhost:3000` (default configuration)
